# APIs

The term API stands for *application programming interface*. An API defines a set of rules and protocols that allow software applications to communicate with each other to exchange data, features and functionality.

Using an API allows to communicate with an application or service without having to know how it's implemented. This communication can range from simply requesting some sort of data to triggering the execution of some functionality in the other service.

APIs are commonly used to expose certain functionality of an application or service to be used by others. This allows to integrate needed functionality from other services into the own application instead of having to develop it from scratch. This can save much time and simplify development in general.
