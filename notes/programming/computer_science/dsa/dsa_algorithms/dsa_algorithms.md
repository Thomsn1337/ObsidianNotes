# Algorithms

An algorithm is a finite sequence of strict instructions which is typically used to solve specific problems or to perform computations. It commonly consists of a finite set of well-defined instructions which are typically performed in a specific sequence in order to achieve a desired outcome.  

Algorithms have to follow a set of defined key characteristics so they can be classified as such:

- An algorithm must have a **finite** amount of steps.
- Each step must be **clearly and unambiguously** defined.
- It has **zero or more** inputs taken from a specified set of objects.
- It produces **at least one** output.
- Each step must be simple enough to be performed **exactly** and in a **finite amount of time**.

The concept of algorithms is commonly used in Mathematics and Computer Science, but it can also be applied to different activities in daily life. A simple example for this would be a cooking recipe. It defines a set of instructions to follow, takes different ingredients as *inputs* and allows to create a meal as *output*.
