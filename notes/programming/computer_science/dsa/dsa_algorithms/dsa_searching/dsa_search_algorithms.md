# Search algorithms

Search algorithms are [algorithms](../dsa_algorithms.md) designed to efficiently navigate through different [data structures](../../dsa_data_structures/dsa_data_structures.md) and find a specified information. They are a fundamental building block for applications like [databases](../../../../databases/databases.md) or search engines.

Search algorithms can be classified based on their used searching mechanism into three main types of algorithms:

- **Linear search algorithms** go over the entire dataset and check each element individually for the target key.
- **Binary searches** repeatedly target the center of the dataset and divide the search space in half. They only work on [sorted](../dsa_sorting/dsa_sorting_algorithms.md) data.
- **Hashing searches** directly map keys to each piece of data based on a [hash function](../dsa_hashing.md).
