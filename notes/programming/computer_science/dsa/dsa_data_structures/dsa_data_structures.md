# Data structures

A data structure defines, how data will be organized and stored in memory. Data structures are designed to allow for efficient access to data stored in them. More precisely, they are collections of values, the relationship between the different values and functions or methods that can be applied to them.

Data structures can vary in complexity and purpose, making different structures more suitable for certain use cases than others. They play a crucial role in programming by optimizing the way data can be managed and accessed.
