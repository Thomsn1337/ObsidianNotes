# Version Control

Version control, also known as source control, is a system and a set of practices to track and manage changes to files and software code. It is mostly used in software development to keep track of different version states of a software project and allows to roll back to a previous version if required.

Version control systems are software tools that help with this process of managing changes. They keep track of every modification in a special kind of database and allow for comparisons and rollbacks in case of a major mistake. They also allow for easy collaboration by keeping track of the changes made by each team member and helping prevent conflicts if multiple people work on the same file.
