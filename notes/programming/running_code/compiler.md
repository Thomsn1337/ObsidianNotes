# Compiler

A compiler converts source code written by humans into machine code that the computer can actually understand. In contrast to an [interpreter](interpreter.md), the compiler takes the source code as an input and creates a new executable file from it.

The compiling process is split up into four main steps:
- Preprocessing
- Compiling
- Assembling
- Linking

## Preprocessing

The preprocessor analyses the source file and prepares it for the compilation, e.g. by processing library includes.

## Compiling

After the source code got preprocessed, the compiler basically converts the source code into assembly code, which is the lowest level of human readable code before machine code.

## Assembling

The assembler takes in the assembly code generated by the compiler and generates the corresponding machine code from it.

## Linking

The machine code generated by the assembler only corresponds to the source code of the compiled file. it doesn't include any libraries yet. The linker searches for all the needed libraries on the system and links them to the assembled file, creating the final executable file.
