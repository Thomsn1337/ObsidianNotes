# Classes

In [JavaScript](../basics/javascript.md) classes do not work the same way as in other [object-oriented](../../../basics/object_oriented_programming.md) languages. They still serve the purpose of creating [objects](js_objects.md), but are just a different syntax for using [constructors](js_object_constructors.md) and [prototypes](js_object_prototype.md).
