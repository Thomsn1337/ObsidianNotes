# Object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming principle based around the concept of *objects*. Objects are complex data structures that can hold different data (commonly called *attributes*) and functions to manipulate that data (commonly called *methods*).

The main idea of OOP is to organize code into *classes*, which are reusable, self-contained blueprints for the creation of objects. Designing a program in such a way can have many benefits:

- [Encapsulation](encapsulation.md), also known as bundling data and methods into separate classes, allows to only expose needed functionality and hide away the inner workings of an class. This allows for modularity, because such modules can easily be exchanged while keeping the same functionality.
- **Inheritance** allows to design classes that build up on each other. A child class (also known as subclass) can inherit properties and method from a parent class (also known as superclass). This can avoid redefining already existing functionality and promotes code reuse.
- [Abstraction](abstraction.md) allows to hide away the complex logic of a function in the inner workings of a class and expose it through simple interfaces.
