# Clean code

Most people think that the majority of the work in software development involves writing code. In reality, a significant amount of the time is spent reading code. This may be code written by other team members, code from a completely different project or even code you wrote yourself some weeks ago. Because of this it is important to be able to write clean code which is easier to read and to understand by others.

## Writing clean code

### Choosing good names

The first important step to write clean code is choosing good names. Giving variables and functions meaningful and descriptive names is beneficial to understand what a certain code snippet will do. It is also important to be consistent with using a certain pattern when choosing a name.

### Consistency is key

Consistency in general is basically the key for writing clean code. You should be consistent with the formatting of the code, if you use tabs or spaces for indentation, how you handle really long lines of text etc. Using a code formatter to format your code can be a great tool to increase consistency.

### Good comments

Comments are another great tool for writing clean code, because they allow to explain functionality directly inside the code, if they are used the right way. Especially beginner programmers tend to be in one of two extremes: they either overuse comments by trying to explain literally everything or they don't use comments at all. A good comment should be like [pseudocode](pseudocode.md), that explains what the purpose of the following code snippet is.
