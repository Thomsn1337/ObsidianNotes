# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in [object-oriented programming](object_oriented_programming.md). It refers to the bundling of related data and methods into **single units**, commonly called **classes**. The main idea behind encapsulation lies in hiding away the internal state, data and functionality of an object and only expose needed functionality to the rest of the program through well-defined interfaces.

In encapsulation, internal properties of an object are never accessed or modified directly, but rather through helper methods. These are commonly known as **accessors** and **mutators**. This allows to define access restrictions and data validation to ensure the integrity of the internal state of an object.
