# Pseudocode

Pseudocode is an important concept in software development. It means writing out the logic of the program in in plain natural language before actually coding it in a programming language. This is important to understand the logic and to see all the required parts of the program.

Writing pseudocode will often start by modelling out the simplest steps required to solve a problem. It can start very simplistic, and all the parts that require more detail will be elaborated in a later step.

Pseudocode can start very simplistic and is written in natural (human) language, but when it gets more specific, it can also start resembling the structure of a real programming language, with variables and functions coming into it naturally.
