# Front-end development

Front-end developers create the graphical part of a website that will be displayed by the browser so that the user can interact with it. They focus on creating, but also on enhancing the user interface (UI) and the user experience (UX) of webpages and web applications. A front-end developer has to create responsive, visually appealing and interactive web interfaces that ensure a positive user experience.

## Technologies

A front-end developer will mainly use [HTML](HTML.md), [CSS](CSS.md) and [JavaScript](JavaScript.md) to create the layout and the styles of the webpages and to make them interactive. Bigger or more complex projects make use of [frameworks](Frameworks.md) to simplify the process of creation.
