# Emmet

Emmet is a powerful extension available for many text editors and IDEs, which allows you to speed up your [HTML](HTML.md) coding by the use of simple snippets. The snippets use [CSS](CSS.md)-like syntax and can be used to create big and complex nestings of tags really fast. It also allows fast assignment of classes and IDs while writing the snippets. If used properly, Emmet is a really powerful tool which can help you code much faster.
