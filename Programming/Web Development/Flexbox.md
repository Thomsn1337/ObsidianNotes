# Flexbox

Flexbox is a [CSS](CSS.md) layout model, which makes it easier to create more complex and responsive layouts in web applications. It allows to turn any [HTML](HTML.md) element into a so called "Flex Container". Items within this container can easily be alligned and spaced across the containers main and cross axis.

Flexbox is an efficient way of spacing out different objects inside a webpage. It does not only allow to space out all items inside a container evenly, it also allows to grow or shrink a certain item by a specific factor depending on the size of the browser window. This specific item then grows or shrinks in relation to the other items inside the container, according to the set factor.
