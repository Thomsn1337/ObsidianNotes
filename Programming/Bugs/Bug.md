# Bug

A bug is a logical error in the design, development or operation of a program that causes it to produce incorrect results or unexpected behaviour.

The story of the term "bug" in software development goes back to the development of the mechanical computer "Harvard Mark II" in 1947. An actual bug, a moth, was trapped in the mechanical components of the computer and caused it to malfunction. This was the first documented use of the term "bug" to describe an error in software development and it got adopted in this field over time.
