# Problem solving

Problem solving is the most important skill a programmer needs. It's the core thing a software developer does. He gets confronted with a problem and needs to find a way to solve it. The usage of the programming languages and other tools are secondary skills. Even though it is so important, it's one of the hardest things to learn for new programmers. Even if they can easily learn the syntax of a language and understand programming principles, they often struggle when they try to create something on their own. The best way of improving your problem solving skill is by writing lots of programs.

The problem solving process includes three fundamental steps:

- Understanding the problem
- Making a plan
- Dividing into sub-problems

## Understand the problem

Before you can solve a problem, you first have to understand what the problem even is. If you don't know what the problem you're trying to solve even is, you can never be sure when you've successfully solved it. To be sure that you understand a problem, you have to be able to explain it to someone in plain English (or your first language).

## Make a plan

When you know what problem you even want to solve, it is important to plan out how you want to solve it. This can be done by answering some simple questions:

- Does the program have a graphical interface?
	- If so, what will it look like and what functions will it have?
	- Make a simple sketch of the layout.
- What input will the program have? How will it receive input?
- What will the output be?
- What are the steps to generate the output according to the input?
- etc.

The next step in the planning process is to write out a basic version of the needed algorithm in [pseudocode](pseudocode.md).

## Divide into sub-problems

While writing the [pseudocode](pseudocode.md), you will automatically start to divide the main problem into smaller sub-problems. Even the steps you need for the algorithm can be sub-problems. The key is to divide them down even further. This can happen while planning, but new sub-problems can also be revealed while trying to solve an existing one. The main problem can be very complex, and trying to solve it directly will be very difficult. The key of problem solving is being able to divide a big problem into smaller ones which are easier to solve, all the way down to the easiest solvable problem.
