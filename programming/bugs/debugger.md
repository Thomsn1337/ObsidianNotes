# Debugger

A debugger is special software that allows you to stop execution of your source code and step over it to analyse its behaviour.

Debuggers are generally used to track down [bugs](bug.md) or to find the cause of crashes in a program. They stop execution at a defined point of the source code, provide information like the current values of variables and allow to slowly step through the code to see how the program behaves when executing.
