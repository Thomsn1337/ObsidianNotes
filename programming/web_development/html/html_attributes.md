# Attributes

[HTML elements](html_elements_tags.md) can have different attributes. The most important attributes are `class` and `id`.

## Class

The `class` attribute is used to group elements together by assigning a class to them. This can be useful to define [css](css.md) rules which target only elements with certain classes, or to apply [javascript](javascript.md) functionality to multiple elements without having to repeat code. Classes can be reused in the document.

## ID

The `id` attribute is used to define a unique identifier for an element. This can be useful to target only one specific element with CSS and/or JavaScript. The identifier has to be unique throughout the entire document. If multiple elements happen to have the same ID, only the first occurrence will be targeted.
